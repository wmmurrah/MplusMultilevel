*   The chi-square value for MLM, MLMV, MLR, ULSMV, WLSM and WLSMV cannot be used
    for chi-square difference testing in the regular way.  MLM, MLR and WLSM
    chi-square difference testing is described on the Mplus website.  MLMV, WLSMV,
    and ULSMV difference testing is done using the DIFFTEST option.
